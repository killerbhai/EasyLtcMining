If you have a question or a problem with deposit or withdraw system, you can create a ticket

If your problem is about withdrawal and the bot has given you a transaction hash ID, your payment is already on its way and out of our control

If it is about deposit, please wait at least 24 hours to recieve confirmations on the blockchain before writing a ticket
